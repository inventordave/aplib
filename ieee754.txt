In binary32,

p (digits in significand) is 24

emax = 127, thus emin = -126 (1 - emax)

Form:

(-1)exp s X b exp e X m

s = 0 or 1

emin <= e <= emax


d0.d1d2d3, where d(n) is subject to the base(radix), thus for binary 0 or 1, for decimal, 0 .. 9

(page 20 of the IEEE754-2008 spec shows the alternate q-form. The above form is called scientific notation, the q-form is where the significand is stored as an Integer.)

This view of the significand as an integer c, with its corresponding exponent q, describes exactly the same
set of zero and non-zero floating-point numbers as the view in scientific form. (For finite floating-point
numbers, e=q+p−1 and m=c×b1−p .)
