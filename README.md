# APlib
An arbitrary-precision library.

Fleshing this lib out over time, it will be used further along as an ap-real driver for rtdt, the visualizer based on my vanilla js raytracer, RTDT. As it's an AP lib, it will require calculus methods, integration and differentiation, along with trig methods to model the physics of the ST-particles in an rtdt-volume.
